# Build your first Astro Blog

In this tutorial, you’ll learn Astro’s key features by building a fully-functioning blog, from zero to full launch! 🚀

Along the way, you’ll:

* Set up your development environment
* Create pages and blog posts for your website
* Build with Astro components
* Query and work with local files
* Add interactivity to your site
* Deploy your site to the web

Want a preview of what you’re going to build? You can view the final project on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo) or open a working version in an online coding environment such as [IDX](https://idx.google.com/import?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwithastro%2Fblog-tutorial-demo%2F) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro).

Note

If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit <https://astro.new> and choose a starter template to open and edit in an online editor.
